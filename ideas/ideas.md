## Pixel Prowler
**Game Title: "Pixel Prowler"**

**Concept**: "Pixel Prowler" is a simple, browser-based stealth game where players control a pixelated character navigating through various levels filled with enemies and obstacles. The objective is to collect items while avoiding detection, using strategy and timing.

**Gameplay Mechanics**:

**Character Control**:

Use arrow keys or WASD for movement.
Spacebar to interact with objects (e.g., collecting items, hiding).

**Levels and Objectives**:

Each level features a unique layout with different themes (e.g., forest, city, dungeon).
Players must collect a specific number of items (e.g., coins, treasures) to complete each level.
Timed challenges can be introduced for extra difficulty.

**Stealth Features**:

Add shadows or cover spots that the player can hide behind to avoid enemy sight lines.

**Enemy AI**:

Different types of enemies with unique behaviors (e.g., patrolling guards, stationary lookouts).
Players can distract enemies by throwing objects or creating sounds in other areas.

**Power-ups**:

Temporary invisibility, speed boosts, or sound dampeners to assist players in their stealth missions.

**Progression System**:

Unlock new characters or skins by completing levels.
Introduce higher difficulty levels as players progress through the game.

**Visuals and Sound**:

Retro pixel art style for charm and simplicity.
8-bit sound effects and background music to enhance the nostalgic gaming experience.

**Technical Implementation Suggestions**:

Use HTML5 Canvas for graphics rendering.
Implement game logic using JavaScript for interactivity and gameplay mechanics.
Utilize CSS for responsive design ensuring compatibility across devices.
Optionally integrate a leaderboard using Firebase for real-time score tracking and player engagement.

**Promotion & Sharing**: Encourage players to share their scores on social media platforms directly from the game interface, generating word-of-mouth promotion. Include an option to replay levels with different strategies or challenge friends to beat their scores.
