# Idea Spinner
## Future enhancements
- [x] Update to use the website's design system.
- [ ] Update to use the website's dynamic theming setting.
- [x] For each session, persist the prior ideas in a list at the bottom of the page.  Do this each time the spin button is clicked.  Ideas should be in a collapsible control that shows the first line of the idea when collapsed.  
- [ ] Add an option to pre-populate the prompt with starter ideas.
- [x] Render the idea returned from the API as markdown, not plain text.  
- [ ] Refactor the test button into a footer control that could be used across applications for testing purposes.  Perhaps just a "debug mode" setting.
- [ ] Add a copy button to the ideas controls.  Allow text to be copied as markdown. 
- [ ] Allow ideas to be persisted to the site, i.e. like a Content Management System, adding ideas to the ideas folder.  
- [ ] Use the GitHub APIs to create a new Issue from a generated idea.  
- [ ] Add a restriction on the number of ideas that can be generated per session.  Don't want to get into a situation where an attack on the site would lead to a huge Azure bill.
