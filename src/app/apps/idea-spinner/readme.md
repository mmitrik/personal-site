# Idea Spinner
## Future enhancements
- [x] Update to use the website's design system.
- [ ] Update to use the website's dynamic theming setting.
- [ ] For each session, persist the prior ideas in a list at the bottom of the page.  Do this each time the spin button is clicked.  Ideas should be in a collapsible control that shows the first line of the idea when collapsed.  
- [ ] Add an option to pre-populate the prompt with starter ideas.
- [x] Render the idea returned from the API as markdown, not plain text.  
- [ ] Refactor the test button into a footer control that could be used across applications for testing purposes.  Perhaps just a "debug mode" setting.
