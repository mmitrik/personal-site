# Idea Spinner
## Future enhancements
- [ ] Update to use the website's design system.
- [ ] For each session, persist the prior ideas in a list at the bottom of the page.  Do this each time the spin button is clicked.  Ideas should be in a collapsible control that shows the first line of the idea when collapsed.  
- [ ] Add an option to pre-populate the prompt with starter ideas.
- [ ] Render the idea returned from the API as markdown, not plain text.
