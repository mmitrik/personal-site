          I&#39;m a seasoned Product & Technical Program Manager with a passion for building 
          innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technical complexity and user needs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted">
          My approach combines strategic thinking with hands-on technical expertise to deliver 
          products that not only meet business objectives but also create meaningful experiences 
          for users.

          When I&#39;m not managing cross-functional teams or diving into technical architectures, 
          you&#39;ll find me experimenting with new technologies and building side projects 
          that you can explore in my projects section.
